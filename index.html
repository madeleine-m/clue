        <div id ="prologue">

            <p><em>(The curtains are closed on a warmly lit stage. WADSWORTH walks out on stage carrying a small table and a CLUE board game. He sets it up the game on the table, taking out the YELLOW piece and setting it down)</em></p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD enters in front of the stage. She whistles with one hand in her pocket, the other holding a letter she is looking over.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK]</p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD stops in her tracks. She turns her head slightly as if to not let the dogs know she sees them.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #2]</p>

            <p><em>(MUSTARD jumps. She turns around and slowly steps backwards)</em></p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Nice...doggy...</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #3]</p>

            <p><strong>MUSTARD.</strong> Oh!</p>

            <p><em>(Startled, MUSTARD jumps again and speeds off in the direction she was headed.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH presents the WHITE piece and sets it down on the board)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WHITE enters from same direction of MUSTARD, looking skeptically around)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #4]</p>

            <p><em>(WHITE steps in the direction of the “dog” that will be in the direction of the audience. She feels her foot step in something. Annoyed, she takes off her shoe and holds it up. She sniffs the air before aggressively sniffing the shoe. Taken aback, she gags as she is overwhelmed by the smell. Disgustedly, she puts her shoe back on and hurries off with a pained look on her face)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH holds up the BLUE piece and sets it down.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(PEACOCK enters holding her coat wrapped around her tightly.)</em></p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #5]</p>

            <p><em>(PEACOCK unsuccessfully attempts to bark back at the dog. She hurries along, satisfied with herself as if she were not just frightened again)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH holds up GREEN piece and sets it down)</em></p>

            <p><em>(GREEN enters from opposite side wondering, obviously confused, and constantly checking the letter he holds in his hand.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> Where is this darn address...</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #6]</p>

            <p><em>(Startled, GREEN points in the direction he came from and then holds up his hand to thank the dog. He hurries off back the way he came from, terrified)</em></p>

            <p><strong>GREEN.</strong> <em>(Nervously to the dog) </em>Thanks.</p>

            <p><em>(Finally, WADSWORTH presents both PURPLE and RED game pieces. He sets them down on the board)</em></p>

            <p><em>(Angrily, SCARLET enters in a huff)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Damn car...piece of junk.</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG BARK #7]</p>

            <p>SCARLET. Shut up!</p>

            <p>[CUE DOG WHIMPER]</p>

            <p><em>(SCARLET attempts to call for help on her phone, but there is no service)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Oh come on...</p>

            <p><em>(PLUM enters slyly from the same direction)</em></p>

            <p><strong>PLUM.</strong> I noticed a car pulled over on the roadside there. Need a lift?</p>

            <p><em>(SCARLET brushes herself off and fixes her hair, attempting to make herself look more attractive)</em></p>

            <p><strong>SCARLET.</strong> Yes please. I’m late for a dinner date.</p>

            <p><strong>PLUM. </strong>Where to?</p>

            <p><em>(Both exit back the way they came from.)</em></p>

            <p><em>(WADSWORTH smiles and stands up straight. He turns to face the curtains with his hands behind his back.)</em></p>

            <p><strong>WADSWORTH. </strong><em>(Calling off to stage L wing.) </em> Curtains, please.</p>

            <p><em>(He follows the curtain off stage. YVETTE comes to pick up the table with the CLUE board and puts it aside.)</em></p>
